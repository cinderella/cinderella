    <title>Changing Host Password</title>
    <para>The password for a XenServer Node, KVM Node, or vSphere Node may be changed in the database.  Note that all Nodes in a Cluster must have the same password.</para>
    <para> To change a Node's password:</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>Identify all hosts in the cluster.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Change the password on all hosts in the cluster.  Now the password for the host and the password known to CloudPlatform will not match.  Operations on the cluster will fail until the two passwords match.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem><para>Get the list of host IDs for the host in the cluster where you are changing the password.  You will need to access the database to determine these host IDs.  For each hostname "h" (or vSphere cluster) that you are changing the password for, execute:</para>
        <programlisting>mysql> select id from cloud.host where name like '%h%';</programlisting>   </listitem>
        <listitem><para>This should return a single ID.  Record the set of such IDs for these hosts.</para></listitem>        
        <listitem><para>Update the passwords for the host in the database. In this example, we change the passwords for hosts with IDs 5, 10, and 12 to "password".</para>
        <programlisting>mysql> update cloud.host set password='password' where id=5 or id=10 or id=12;</programlisting></listitem>
