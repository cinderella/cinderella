    <title>Removing vSphere Hosts</title>
    <para>To remove this type of host, first place it in maintenance mode, as described in <xref linkend="scheduled-maintenance-maintenance-mode-hosts"/>. Then use CloudPlatform to remove the host. CloudPlatform will not direct commands to a host that has been removed using CloudPlatform. However, the host may still exist in the vCenter cluster.</para>
