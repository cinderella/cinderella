	<title>Private and Public Templates</title>
	<para>When a user creates a template, it can be designated private or public.</para>
	<para>Private templates are only available to the user who created them. By default, an uploaded template is private.</para>
	<para>When a user marks a template as “public,” the template becomes available to all users in all accounts in the user's domain, as well as users in any other domains that have access to the Zone where the template is stored. This depends on whether the Zone, in turn, was defined as private or public. A private Zone is assigned to a single domain, and a public Zone is accessible to any domain. If a public template is created in a private Zone, it is available only to users in the domain assigned to that Zone. If a public template is created in a public Zone, it is available to all users in all domains.</para>
