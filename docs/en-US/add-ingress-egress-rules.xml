		<listitem><para>To add an ingress rule, click the Ingress Rules tab and fill out the following fields to specify what network traffic is allowed into VM instances in this security group. If no ingress rules are specified, then no traffic will be allowed in, except for responses to any traffic that has been allowed out through an egress rule.</para>

			<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Add by CIDR/Account</emphasis>. Indicate whether the source of the
						traffic will be defined by IP address (CIDR) or an existing security group
						in a CloudPlatform account (Account). Choose Account if you want to allow
						incoming traffic from all VMs in another security group</para></listitem>			
			<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Protocol</emphasis>. The networking protocol that sources will use to
						send traffic to the security group. TCP and UDP are typically used for data
						exchange and end-user communications. ICMP is typically used to send error
						messages or network monitoring data.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Start Port, End Port</emphasis>. (TCP, UDP only) A range of listening
						ports that are the destination for the incoming traffic. If you are opening
						a single port, use the same number in both fields.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">ICMP Type, ICMP Code</emphasis>. (ICMP only) The type of message and
						error code that will be accepted.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">CIDR</emphasis>. (Add by CIDR only) To accept only traffic from IP
						addresses within a particular address block, enter a CIDR or a
						comma-separated list of CIDRs. The CIDR is the base IP address of the
						incoming traffic. For example, 192.168.0.0/22. To allow all CIDRs, set to
						0.0.0.0/0.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold">Account, Security Group</emphasis>. (Add by Account only) To accept only
						traffic from another security group, enter the CloudPlatform account and

						allow traffic between VMs within the security group you are editing now,
						enter the same name you used in step 7.</para></listitem>
