    <para>CloudPlatform expects that a customer will have their own user provisioning infrastructure. It provides APIs to integrate with these existing systems where the systems call out to CloudPlatform to add/remove users..</para>
    <para>CloudPlatform supports pluggable authenticators. By default, CloudPlatform assumes it is provisioned with the userâ€™s password, and as a result authentication is done locally. However, external authentication is possible as well. For example, see Using an LDAP Server for User Authentication .</para>
