    <title>HA for Management Server</title>
    <para>The CloudPlatform Management Server should be deployed in a multi-node configuration such that it is not susceptible to individual server failures. The Management Server itself (as distinct from the MySQL database) is stateless and may be placed behind a load balancer.</para>
    <para>Normal operation of Hosts is not impacted by an outage of all Management Serves. All guest VMs will continue to work.</para>
    <para>When the Management Server is down, no new VMs can be created, and the end user and admin UI, API, dynamic load distribution, and HA will cease to work.</para>
