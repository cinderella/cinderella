    <title>Secondary Storage Outage and Data Loss</title>
    <para>For a Zone that has only one secondary storage server, a secondary storage outage will have feature level impact to the system but will not impact running guest VMs. It may become impossible to create a VM with the selected template for a user. A user may also not be able to save snapshots or examine/restore saved snapshots. These features will automatically be available when the secondary storage comes back online.</para>
    <para>Secondary storage data loss will impact recently added user data including templates, snapshots, and ISO images. Secondary storage should be backed up periodically.Multiple secondary storage servers can be provisioned within each zone to increase the scalability of the system.</para>
