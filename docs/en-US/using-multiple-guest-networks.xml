	<title>Using Multiple Guest Networks</title>
	<para>In zones that use advanced networking, additional networks for guest traffic may be added at any time after the initial installation. You can also customize the domain name associated with the network by specifying a DNS suffix for each network.</para>
	<para>A VM's networks are defined at VM creation time.  A VM cannot add or remove networks after it has been created, although the user can go into the guest and remove the IP address from the NIC on a particular network.</para>
	<para>Each VM has just one default network.  The virtual router's DHCP reply will set the guest's default gateway as that for the default network.  Multiple non-default networks may be added to a guest in addition to the single, required default network. The administrator can control which networks are available as the default network.</para>
	<para>Additional networks can either be available to all accounts or be assigned to a specific account.  Networks that are available to all accounts are zone-wide.  Any user with access to the zone can create a VM with access to that network.  These zone-wide networks provide little or no isolation between guests. Networks that are assigned to a specific account provide strong isolation.</para>
