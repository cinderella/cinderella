		<title>Change to Behavior of List Commands</title>
		<para>There was a major change in how our List* API commands work in CloudStack 3.0 compared to 2.2.x. The rules below apply only for managed resources â€“ those that belong to an account, domain, or project. They are irrelevant for the List* commands displaying unmanaged (system) resources, such as hosts, clusters, and external network resources.</para>
		<para>When no parameters are passed in to the call, the caller sees only resources owned by the caller (even when the caller is the administrator). Previously, the administrator saw everyone else's resources by default.</para>
		<para>When accountName and domainId are passed in:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>The caller sees the resources dedicated to the account specified.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>If the call is executed by a regular user, the user is authorized to specify only the user's own account and domainId.</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>If the caller is a domain administrator, CloudStack performs an authorization check to see whether the caller is permitted to view resources for the given account and domainId.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>When projectId is passed in, only resources belonging to that project are listed.</para>
		<para>When domainId is passed in, the call returns only resources belonging to the domain specified. To see the resources of subdomains, use the parameter isRecursive=true. Again, the regular user can see only resources owned by that user, the root administrator can list anything, and a domain administrator is authorized to see only resources of the administrator's own domain and subdomains.</para>
		<para>To see all resources the caller is authorized to see, except for Project resources, use the parameter listAll=true.</para>
		<para>To see all Project resources the caller is authorized to see, use the parameter projectId=-1.</para>
		<para>There is one API command that doesn't fall under the rules above completely: the listTemplates command. This command has its own flags defining the list rules:</para>
