    <title>Load Balancer Rules</title>
    <para>A CloudPlatform user or administrator may create load balancing rules that balance traffic received at a public IP to one or more VMs. A user creates a rule, specifies an algorithm, and assigns the rule to a set of VMs.</para>
    <note><para>If you create load balancing rules while using a network service offering that includes an external load balancer device such as NetScaler, and later change the network service offering to one that uses the CloudPlatform virtual router, you must create a firewall rule on the virtual router for each of your existing load balancing rules so that they continue to function.</para></note>
