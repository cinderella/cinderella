	<title>Deployment Architecture Overview</title>
	<para>
		A &PRODUCT; installation consists of two parts: the Management Server and the cloud infrastructure that it manages. When you set up and manage a &PRODUCT; cloud, you provision resources such as hosts, storage devices, and IP addresses into the Management Server, and the Management Server manages those resources.
	</para>
	<para>
		The minimum production installation consists of one machine running the &PRODUCT; Management Server and another machine to act as the cloud infrastructure (in this case, a very simple infrastructure consisting of one host running hypervisor software). In a trial installation, a single machine can act as both the Management Server and the hypervisor host (using the KVM hypervisor).

	<para>A more full-featured installation consists of a highly-available multi-node Management Server installation and up to thousands of hosts using any of several advanced networking setups. For information about deployment options, see Choosing a Deployment Architecture.
